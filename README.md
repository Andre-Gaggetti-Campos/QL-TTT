# QL-TTT

Q-Learning-TicTacToe (or QL-TTT) is an inline CLI program where users can train bots with customizable conditions, pitch the bots against eachother, play against a bot, or play by themselves, all in a 3x3 or unique 5x5 TicTacToe environment.

## Roadmap

1. ~~Plan/sketch the CLI interface for non-bot related play.~~
2. ~~Implement base interface.~~
3. Allow computer-based play (random).
4. Implement base Q-Learning schematic.
